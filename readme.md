This is a demostration on how to make UIKit work in Cocos2D based on below discussion:
http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forums/topic/ccuiviewwrapper-wrapper-for-manipulating-uiviews-using-cocos2d

Thanks very much to @Blue Ether for the first version of the wrapper, and @didillon for resolving the rotation problem.

I simply replace those deprecated methods with those in Cocos2d 2.x.

Actually, I am new to Cocos2d too and I was doing some experiments :)  

So, please don't pay too much attention on the other part of the project. Feel free to use the code.

thanks,
Devon Zhang
